This is a repository for me to expand my own analysis of my own music taste. I often find that as great as Spotify's built-in recommendation algorithm is, I often am looking for more when it comes to qualitative comparision/contract, so I'm wondering if I can procedurally generate recommendations in a way that's more up to speed with the qualities I knowingly or unknowingly consider. *I am basing this on the features available in the Spotify platform, I'm just wondering if I can figure out a way to use them in a unique way to more accurately pinpoint my tastes.*

I already put way too much effort into making these playlists anyway, so why not do a little more comprehensive analysis?

In particular, I'm trying to find a way to further qualify how I decide what songs go into a playlist and what songs don't. 

Some bases to be aware of:

**quasi** - this is a big old data dump playlist of every song on the spotify platform I've listened to and liked. Therefore, I parse through it as a means of essentially iterating through candidates of songs to recommend for playlists based on music that I'm known to already like.

**sponge berry // gradient** - this playlist is a similar data dump, but transitions song to song in a logical fashion so songs that I judge to be more similar will be closer together to each other. It's not perfect, but I'm considering using it as a way to qualify how I judge songs to be similar to each other. This will be a challenge. 

**2012** - a playlist that I intend to use for a lot of testing purposes, because it's a playlist where I understand myself why all the songs fit on it, but it's very hard for me to put it into words why that is. Since it has a lot of cohesion for my tastes, I'm using it as a standard test for the recommendations, since I can clearly listen to a programmatically generated song and decide if it actually does fit in the playlist.

God I spend too much time on this.
